                        <p>The Electronics Club places a high importance on critical thinking and problem-solving
                            abilities. The Coding Society wants to create a culture of coding on campus that
                            includes all students who have a passion for it. You can work together, gain knowledge
                            from others, and even share what you know with them in the Coding Society, all in a
                            setting that is very different from the demands of academic study.</p>
                        <p><b>Active participants of the club will be rewarded.</b><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>Students will create answers to challenges in the real world while receiving expert
                            guidance. Teaming up with people that have similar interests to your own can also help
                            you to be more creative, motivated, and innovative. Along with improving your technical
                            coding abilities, joining a club can assist you in developing the "soft skills"
                            necessary for advancing in your career.</p>
